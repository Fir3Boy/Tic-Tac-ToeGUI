# Tic-Tac-ToeGUI
primary program (applying cs1102 knowledge)
This is my first project, in order to solidfy my knowledge in Java and programming in genral, although it is full of semantically bugs, and it is way more primary than it should be, but I will refine it later.

| Rank | Bug/flaw |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1|        the check method is not efficient      |
|     2|       Need to add menu bar        |
|     3|          No new game button     |
|     4|          ?    |

Should get a more efficient algortihm for check()
